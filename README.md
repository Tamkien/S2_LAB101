# S2_LAB101
C Lab

This is where I store solutions of LAB101 (C Lab). All of those make more than 600 locs, just enough. BUT those are plain ideas only (bugs expected). The full solutions which I actually submitted had been edited A LOT in the Lab room. Therefore they won't be uploaded here (for free). Stuck at C Lab? Consider donating me some packets of noodle and I'll help.
